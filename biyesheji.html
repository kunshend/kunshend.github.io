    <p>介绍毕业设计? Graduation Project(数据库)</p>
    <p>My graduation project was about building a web-based data system.
I worked mainly on database design — creating tables, writing SQL, and connecting it with the website.
This project helped me understand how data is stored and used in real life.
But at that time, I focused more on building the system, not on analyzing data or using AI.
So now I want to study Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence to learn how to use data to make smart decisions.
I also applied for Information Technology Management, because I want to know how to manage IT projects and make technical work support business goals.
I think both programs can help me connect my coding background with data and management skills.
