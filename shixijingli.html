    <p>实习经历:</p>
    <p>I worked as a research assistant at the Institute of Artificial Intelligence, Chinese Academy of Sciences.
It was a remote internship, focusing on using AI methods to predict mechanical failures.</p>
<p>I used Python, FFT, and deep learning models to process industrial data and compare AI-based and traditional prediction methods.
This experience helped me understand how data and AI can be applied to real industrial problems,
which connects closely to courses like Machine Learning in the daai program</p>
<p>It also improved my self-learning and project coordination skills,
which are very useful for IT Project Management in the Itm program.</p>
<p>So this internship gave me both technical experience in AI and soft skills in project management,
which fits perfectly with the two programs I’m applying for.</p>
