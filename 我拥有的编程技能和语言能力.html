    <p>我拥有的编程语言</p>
<p>I’ve worked with several programming languages and technologies during my study and internship.</p>
<p>For languages, I mainly use Java, Python, and C.
I used Java in my Software Engineering project to build an Android job-search app,
Python in my AI internship for data processing and deep learning,
and C in my Operating Systems course to implement process scheduling and memory management.</p>
<p>(These experiences gave me both software development and data analytics skills,
which I believe fit very well with the Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence and Information Technology Management programs.)</p>
