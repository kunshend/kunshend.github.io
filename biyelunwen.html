    <p>不谈这个专业相关,只谈毕业论文</p>
    <p>My graduation thesis is about the legal and ethical issues in artificial intelligence.
It explores how AI systems can cause problems such as privacy risks, data bias, and responsibility in decision-making.
I think as AI becomes more common, it’s not only important to know how to build AI models, but also how to use them responsibly and safely.
Through this topic, I learned that technology is not just about coding or algorithms — it also affects people, society, and even laws.
This project helped me understand the balance between innovation and responsibility, which I believe is very meaningful for my future study in DAAI, and ITM.

 <p>毕业论文跟专业相关?</p>
    <p>My graduation thesis is about the legal and ethical issues in artificial intelligence.
It explores how AI systems can lead to problems such as privacy risks, data bias, and accountability in decision-making.

This topic made me realize that AI is not just about building models — it’s also about managing data properly and using technology responsibly.</p>
<p>I’m especially interested in how data quality and algorithm transparency affect fairness,
which connects closely to courses like Data Analytics and Machine Learning in the DAAI program.

At the same time, this research also relates to Information Technology Management,
because it involves understanding how organizations should set policies and manage technology ethically.</p>
<p>So this thesis helped me understand both the technical and management sides of AI,
and that’s why I think it fits well with the two programs I’m applying for.</p>
