    <p>你对daai和itm的课程了解多少</p>
    <p>问daai课程了解</p>
    <p>I’ve read through the DAAI program structure(死抓科特), and I’m really interested in how it combines data analytics, AI modeling, and real-world applications.</p>
<P>I’m especially interested in courses like Machine Learning and Big Data Analytics.</P>
<p>During my internship, 
I used Python, FFT, and deep learning models to predict mechanical faults.
That experience helped me understand how important data quality and model design are,
and I hope this program will help me learn these skills in a more systematic(谁死特卖忒课) and professional way.</P>

<p>I think are very useful for applying AI responsibly in the real world.</p>
<p>daai的未来作用</p>
<p>I think Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence will become the core driving force of digital transformation in almost every industry.
In the future, AI won’t just automate simple tasks — it will help organizations make smarter decisions, predict trends, and personalize services.
Data will be the new “fuel” for innovation, and professionals who can understand both data and AI techniques will be highly valued.
That’s why I want to build solid skills in machine learning, deep learning, and business analytics through this program.</p>


<p>问itm课程了解</p>

<p>I understand that the ITM program focuses on how to manage technology projects, people, and innovation.
I’m very interested in courses like IT Project Management and Technology Strategy,
because they help connect technical work with business decision-making.

In my software engineering project, my team built an Android job-search app,
and I was responsible for the notification system and data dashboard.
That experience showed me how important communication and planning are for success.

So I think ITM fits me well — it will help me combine my technical background with leadership and organizational skills,
and prepare me to handle both technology and management challenges in the future.</p>
<p>itm在未来的作用</p>
<p>I believe Information Technology Management will play a key role in connecting business strategy with technological innovation.
In the future, managers need to understand not only technology, but also how to lead digital transformation, manage data resources, and ensure cybersecurity.
ITM professionals will bridge the gap between technical teams and business leaders, making organizations more competitive.</p>

<p>问daai和itm的课程了解</p>
<p>I’ve studied both programs carefully, and I really like how they complement each other.

The DAAI program focuses on AI and data skills, with courses like Machine Learning and Data Analytics,
while the ITM program focuses on project planning and management, with courses like IT Project Management and Technology Strategy.

In my AI internship, I worked with deep learning models and data analysis,
and in my software engineering project, I practiced teamwork and coordination.

So I think both programs fit my background perfectly —
DAAI helps me improve my technical skills,
and ITM helps me strengthen my organizational and leadership abilities.
Together, they give me a complete skill set for the IT industry.</p>
