    <p>什么是python,FFT和深度学习模型</p>
    <p>Python is a simple but powerful programming language.
It’s great for data analysis and AI modeling, and I use it for data cleaning and visualization.</p>

<p>FFT, or Fast Fourier Transform, helps analyze signal frequencies — I used it to clean vibration data before AI training.</p>

<p>Deep learning models are AI algorithms like CNN, RNN, and Transformer that learn from data to make predictions.
These tools are the foundation of Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence,
and learning to apply them responsibly is also part of Information Technology Management.</p>
<p>这些技术跟daai关系,跟itm关系</p>
<p>For the Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence program,
Python, FFT, and deep learning are core tools for data analysis, signal processing, and machine learning.
In my internship, I used them to clean and analyze industrial data,
which connects closely to courses like Machine Learning and Big Data Analytics.
So I think the program will help me deepen these technical skills and apply them more systematically.</p>
<p>For Information Technology Management,
learning these tools also helps me understand how technical projects are organized and managed.
For example, in AI projects, you need both technical accuracy and good coordination between developers and managers.</p>
