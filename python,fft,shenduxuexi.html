<p>For Java, I used it the most in my Software Engineering project.
My team built an Android job-search app, and I was responsible for the notification system and data dashboard.
Through this, I learned how to design software structure, communicate in a team, and manage technical tasks —
which connects closely with Information Technology Management, especially IT Project Management and Technology Strategy.</p>
<p>For Python, I used it in my AI internship at the Institute of Artificial Intelligence, Chinese Academy of Sciences.
I processed industrial data using FFT and deep learning models to predict mechanical faults.
It helped me understand data analytics, model training, and AI applications,
which relates directly to the Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence program.</p>
<p>For C, I used it in Operating Systems and System Programming courses,
where I implemented modules like process scheduling and memory management.
It gave me a deeper understanding of how computers work at a low level
and strengthened my problem-solving and logical thinking, which are also useful for AI system optimization and software design.</p>
<p>For Machine learning, that means using algorithms that can learn from data automatically.
During my internship at the Institute of Artificial Intelligence,
I used deep learning models to predict mechanical faults from industrial signal data.
It helped me understand how the model improves itself through training,
and how important data preprocessing and feature quality are for accuracy.</p>
<p>For Deep learning, that is a type of machine learning that uses neural networks to learn complex patterns.
I applied CNN and Transformer models in my internship to detect patterns in vibration data.
It showed me how powerful deep learning can be for handling unstructured data,
and that’s why I’m really interested in the DAAI courses like Deep Learning and Big Data Analytics.</p>
<p> for Data analytics, that is about finding patterns and insights from raw data.
In my AI internship, I cleaned and analyzed industrial data before training the model —
for example, I used FFT to remove noise and prepare the dataset.
This process made me realize that data quality is as important as the algorithm itself.</p>
<p>IT project management is about organizing and leading technology projects effectively.
In my software engineering project, our team built an Android job-search app.
I learned how to divide tasks, plan the schedule, and test the system —
this experience helped me understand the importance of coordination and communication in tech projects.</p>
<p>AI ethics is about using AI in a way that’s fair, transparent, and safe.
In my graduation thesis, I studied legal and ethical issues in AI,
such as privacy risks, data bias, and accountability.
It made me realize that building AI models isn’t enough — we also need to think about how to use them responsibly.</p>
