    <p>为什么选择daai</p>
    <p>I chose Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence because it’s directly related to my internship experience.
At the Institute of Artificial Intelligence, Chinese Academy of Sciences, I used Python and deep learning to analyze industrial data and predict faults.</p>
<p>I’m especially interested in courses like Machine Learning and Deep Learning,
because I used these models in practice but only at a basic level.
I want to study them more deeply and understand how to improve model performance and data quality.</p>    
<p>So I think DAAI will help me turn my internship experience into real professional AI and data skills.</p>

<p>为什么选择ITM</p>
<p>I chose Information Technology Management because my project experience made me realize that good technology also needs good management.</p>
<p>In my software engineering project, my team built an Android job-search app, and I learned the importance of planning and coordination.
That’s why I’m very interested in the course IT Project Management —
it teaches how to organize teams, schedule tasks, and manage large-scale technical projects.</p>
<p>I think this program can help me connect my technical skills with leadership and management.</p>
<p>为什么选择daai+itm这两个专业</p>
<p>I chose DAAI and ITM because they perfectly combine my interests and experience.

DAAI focuses on building and analyzing intelligent systems, while ITM focuses on managing and planning technology projects — both are important for the future of IT.</p>
<p>In my AI internship at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, I used Python, FFT, and deep learning models to predict mechanical faults.
That connects closely with DAAI courses like Machine Learning and Deep Learning, which will help me go deeper into data analysis and AI applications.</p>
<p>n my Software Engineering project, my team built an Android job-search app, where I learned teamwork, coordination, and project planning.
That matches ITM courses such as IT Project Management and Technology Strategy.(死拽特贼)</p>
<p>Together, these two programs can help me become a professional who understands both technical innovation and management strategy(斯拽特贼),
which I think is essential in today’s data-driven world.</p>


<p>你对这两个专业感兴趣吗?/那个更感兴趣?</p>
<p>Yes, I’m interested in both sides,
but I would say I’m a bit more interested in DAAI,
because my internship was mainly about AI and data analysis,
and I really enjoyed using data to solve real problems.

But I also believe ITM is very helpful,
because understanding management will help me apply those AI skills effectively in real projects.</p>
<p>这两个专业的联系</p>
<p>I think DAAI focuses on how to build and analyze intelligent systems,
while ITM focuses on how to plan and manage those systems effectively.
Both are important for the future of technology.</p>
