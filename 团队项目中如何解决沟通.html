<p>在团队项目中如何解决沟通问题</p>
<p>In team projects, I always value communication and coordination.
For example, in my Software Engineering course, my team developed an Android app called QuickCash.
At first, we had some communication challenges because everyone had different schedules and ideas about the project structure.
To solve this, I suggested thatGitHub for version control.
I also proposed using Google Firebase as our database platform, since it allowed real-time data synchronization and was easy to integrate with Android Studio.</p>

<p>Besides online communication, we regularly booked a study room on campus to discuss our code together and solve issues face to face.
We also used Microsoft Teams for quick updates and file sharing.

Through this experience, I learned the importance of proactive communication and technical collaboration.
By combining the right tools and teamwork, we avoided code conflicts, completed the app smoothly.</p>
