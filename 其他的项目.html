    <p> 有其他的项目,数据库和网络安全</p>
<p>Yes, I’ve also done several other projects besides my internship and software engineering app.</p>
<p>For example, I built a Database Management System in my Database Systems course, using MySQL to design tables, relationships, and transactions for a library system.
It helped me understand how data is stored, processed, and optimized, which connects well to Data Analytics and AI.</p>
<p>I also worked on a Network Security project, where I set up a virtual attack-defense environment using VMware and Wireshark.
That project taught me about data protection and cybersecurity, which are also key parts of Information Technology Management.</p>
<p>These projects helped me strengthen both my technical and analytical skills, and I believe they relate well to the programs I’m applying for.</p>
