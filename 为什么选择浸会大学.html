<p>I chose your university because it has a strong reputation in both academics and research.
In recent QS World University Rankings, it is among the top universities in Asia(a惹),
and its Computer Science Faculty are well recognized</p>
<p>What I like most is that your programs combine technical learning with practical application —
for example, courses like Machine Learning, Big Data Analytics, and IT Project Management focus on real-world problem solving and teamwork.</p>
<p>These courses match my background very well.
In my AI internship at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, I worked with Python, FFT, and deep learning to process industrial data and predict faults,
which connects to the Data Analytics and AI program.</p>
<p>And in my Software Engineering project, I helped build an Android job-search app,
which taught me project coordination and teamwork, connecting closely with the Information Technology Management program.

</p>
<p>So I believe your university provides the ideal environment to help me grow both technically and professionally.</p>
