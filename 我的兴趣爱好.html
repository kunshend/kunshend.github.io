<p>我的兴趣爱好</p>
<p>In my free time, I really enjoy fishing.
It helps me relax and stay patient, and I think it’s similar to programming —
both require focus, timing, and persistence.

I also like creating small projects by myself.
For example, I once developed a simple animal-raising game just for fun.
It wasn’t for publishing, but I enjoyed the process of designing logic and interactions.

These hobbies help me stay creative and focused, which I think are also important qualities for studying AI and IT.</p>
