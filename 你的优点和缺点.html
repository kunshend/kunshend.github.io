    <p>你的优点和缺点是什么？</p>
    <p>My strength(斯准) is that I like to keep learning.
I not only study what I learn in class, but I also plan my time to learn new things every day.
I always want to get more practical skills, not just theory.
Sometimes I put pressure on myself, but I think that pressure gives me motivation.
My weakness is that I don’t have much hands-on experience yet — most of my knowledge comes from school.
Sometimes it’s also hard to get into the learning state of mind, but I’m working to fix that.
I usually go to the library five days a week, which helps me stay focused and study better.
