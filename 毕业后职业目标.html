    <p>毕业后你的职业目标是什么？</p>
    <p>笼统的职业目标</p>
    <p>I think by studying Data Analytics(爱讷莱斯特) and Artificial Intelligence, I can work in a technical job, such as data analyst or AI developer. The DAAI program focuses more on data and AI, which fits my interest and background. By studying Information Technology Management, I can also choose management or decision-making roles in the future. But I prefer technical jobs, because I think they are more stable and help me build strong skills at the beginning of my career.</p>
<p>DAAI的职业目标</p>
<p>My goal in Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence is to become a data analyst or AI engineer.
In my internship ,
I used Python, FFT, and deep learning models to analyze data and predict mechanical faults.
That experience made me realize how powerful AI can be in solving real problems.

I think the trend now is that AI is used everywhere, like in business and industry.
To keep up, I plan to keep learning machine learning,  and new AI tools.

I also like creating small projects, like a simple animal-raising game I built myself —
it helps me practice coding and creative thinking.
So I think DAAI fits me very well, because I love using data and creativity to build something useful.</p>

<p>itm的职业目标</p>
<p>My goal in Information Technology Management is to become an IT project manager or technology consultant(肯骚tant).
In my Software Engineering course project, my team built an Android job-search app,
and I was responsible for the notification system and dashboard.
That project taught me teamwork, planning, and communication, which are very important for management.

I think the trend in ITM is digital transformation —
companies are using data and AI to improve decision-making.

So I want to learn how to lead technical projects effectively through the ITM program.</p>
