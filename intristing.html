    <p>Good afternoon, professor. My name is Hankun Dong, and I’m from Dalhousie University in Canada, majoring in Computer Science.
I’m now in my final semester and will graduate this December.
I have some internship and project experience that I’d like to share.</p>
    <p>First, for my internship, I worked as a research assistant at the Institute of Artificial Intelligence, Chinese Academy of Sciences.
It was a remote internship, where I used Python and deep learning to analyze industrial data and predict mechanical faults.
This experience helped me build strong skills in data processing and AI modeling.</p>
<p>Second, for my project experience, I joined a software engineering team project, where we built an Android job-search app.
That project gave me valuable experience in teamwork and problem-solving.</p>
<p>Finally, I’m applying for Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence, and Information Technology Management at your university,
because these programs match my technical background and my interest in data and management.
I believe these majors will really help me grow in technology and management skills.</p>
