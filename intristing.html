<p>Hi, my name is Hankun Dong. I’m from Dalhousie University in Canada, and I’m now in my final semester, majoring in Computer Science.
I’ve done some AI-related work, like a research internship at the Institute of Artificial Intelligence, and a team project where we built an Android app.
These experiences made me interested in using data and AI to solve real-world problems.
That’s why I’m applying for the DAAI and ITM programs — they really match my skills and interests.</p>
