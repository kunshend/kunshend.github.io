    <p>你在本科都学了什么课程?</p>
    <p>I’ve taken a software engineering course, where I worked on a project and got an A+ grade.
I also studied UI design, using Figma to create user interface layouts.
In my network security course, I used Wireshark for packet capture and VMware virtual machines to test network attacks and defenses.
I also learned database design, building my own database using MySQL, and I can write and run multiple SQL statements independently.
Although these projects are not directly related to my application, they gave me a strong technical foundation.
That’s why I’m very interested in the DAAI and ITM programs at HKBU— I want to connect my technical background with my apply programs.
