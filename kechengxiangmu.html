    <p>课程项目? </p>
<p>In my Software Engineering course, my team of six students built an Android job-search app using Java in Android Studio.
I was responsible for the user logout function, the dashboard module, and real-time notifications between job seekers and job posts</p>
<p>Through this project, I learned a lot about data flow, user interaction, and system integration — how information moves between users, databases, and the interface.
That experience made me more interested in data processing and analytics, which connects directly to daai.</p>
<p>At the same time, working in a team taught me about project coordination, communication, and time management, which are important parts of ITM</p>
<p>So I think this project helped me build both technical and management skills, which I hope to develop further at HKBU.</p>
