<p>I think whether I stay in Hong Kong after graduation will depend on three main factors —
my personal ability, my language skills, and the job opportunities available.</p>
<p>First, I hope that after completing my master’s degree, I can get enough technical and professional ability to work in Hong Kong’s techical or data industry.
If I’m ability enough, I’ll be happy to stay and contribute here.</p>
<p>Second, language is also important.
I can speak English and Mandarin, and I’m planning to learn some Cantonese,
because I know it can help me communicate better in the local working environment.</p>
<p>Third, it depends on job opportunities.
Hong Kong has many openings in data analytics, AI, and IT management,
so if I find a suitable position, I’d love to stay and get experience.</p>
<p>But no matter where I work in the future, I believe studying here will give me strongcareer connections.</p>
