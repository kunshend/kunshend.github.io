    <p>用c,java,python都做过什么项目?</p>
    <p>I’ve used Java, C, and Python in different types of projects.</p>
<p>For Java, I mainly used it in our Software Engineering project.
My team built an Android job-search app, and I was responsible for the notification system and data dashboard.
This project helped me learn software structure, teamwork, and project coordination,
which connects well with Information Technology Management,
especially courses like IT Project Management and Technology Strategy.</p>
<p>For C, I used it in my Operating Systems course to implement modules like process scheduling and memory management.
It helped me understand how systems run at a low level and improved my logical thinking and problem-solving skills.
These skills are very useful for data structure design and system optimization in data analytics and AI.</p>
<p>For Python, I used it in my AI internship at the Institute of Artificial Intelligence, Chinese Academy of Sciences.
I processed industrial signal data and used FFT and deep learning models to predict mechanical faults.
This experience connects directly to Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence,
because it involved data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
Now I keep practicing Python every day, since it’s essential for both AI development and data analysis</p>
