软件工程的最大挑战?
</p>
    <p>For The biggest problem I think is software engineering course program, i met was in the notification system.
Messages didn’t show up, and I thought it was a code problem, so I spent a long time checking my code.
Later, I found the real reason — I didn’t give the app the notification permission on the phone.
After I turned it on with help from my teaching assistant, the system worked well.

</p>
<p>So i feel that sometimes the problem is not in the code but in the settings, and I learned to check all details before testing.</p>
